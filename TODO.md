## Tasks

- [x] Replace content with About Me sections (e.g., UI/UX Design, Mobile Development, Internship Experience)
- [x] Keep the face image (/profileporto.jpeg) in the prominent left card
- [x] Adapt headings and descriptions to user's profile
- [x] Test the component in the browser (dev server running on http://localhost:5174/)

## Notes
